# dotFiles
These are my linux dot files for vim, tmux and bashrc.  I simply got tired of copying them around
and thought it would be easier if they were in a git repo.


In case this isn't obvious I would checkout this repostitory in my ~ directory and then ln -s these files into the correct places in the file system.
